# UNP_REGRESSION_PROJECT_WITH_PYTHON_MEDICAL_INSURANCE_PREMIUM_ANALYSIS

This project focuses on predicting medical insurance premiums using the Medical Insurance Dataset. The dataset includes demographic and lifestyle details such as Age, Sex, BMI, Number of Children, Smoker status, and Region, which are used to estimate the insurance charges for individuals. The main objective of the project is to build and evaluate regression models that can help understand the relationship between these factors and medical expenses. The process involved several key steps â€” beginning with data collection and preprocessing, where missing values were identified and treated, outliers were handled, and categorical variables were encoded. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was then conducted to visualize the data and uncover important patterns and correlations among variables. A multicollinearity check was performed to ensure reliability of predictors before model implementation. Various machine learning regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest were applied and tested with different data splits. The project was executed using Python in Google Colab, employing libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. A PowerPoint presentation was created to summarize the workflow, analysis, and model-building process. The repository includes links to both the Colab Notebook and the PPT Presentation, providing a complete overview of the project.
